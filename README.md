# play-akka-telegrambot4s
Small library to handle multiple conversations with a telegram bot.

# This project is under development!

This library should help you with:

* Handling the state of each user.
* Create a FSM (finite state machine) to design the conversation.
* Provide you some helpers needed in your conversations.
* Mix in stateless Services
* Allow you to add aspects to your conversations.

Like the name suggests it's supporting only Telegram. The idea is to extend that to other 
messaging provider at a later time.

**Before you start your own project, please check:**

# Token configuration
It allows you to add the token in the classpath (add `bot.token`-file in the `conf`-directory).

Or pass it as a system property, like `-DBOT_TOKEN=[token]`

## Service (stateless)
To get an information from the Bot that does not need any interaction with 
the Bot, you can use a Service (stateless request). 
Here an example:
```scala
/**
  * The user sends command /hello
  * The Bot answers with hello to the user
  */
case class HelloService()
  extends ChatService { // this is a Service

  // the standard actor receive method
  def receive: Receive = {
    // a service only receives the message without any callback data
    case Command(msg, _) =>
      // return a simple hello with a Bot helper
      bot.sendMessage(msg, s"hello ${msg.from.map(_.firstName)}") 
    case other =>
      warn(s"Not expected message: $other")
  }
}
```
Provide a standard constructor for an Actor:
```scala
object HelloService {
  // the command to listen for
  val command = "/hello"

  // constructor of the Service - which is an Actor
  def props: Props = Props(HelloService())
}
```
And finally subscribe the Service:
```scala
// a singleton will inject all needed dependencies and subscribe the service
@Singleton
class HelloServiceSubscription @Inject()(@Named("commandDispatcher")
                                              val commandDispatcher: ActorRef
                                              , val system: ActorSystem) {
import HelloService._

  // subscribe the HelloService to the CommandDispatcher
  commandDispatcher ! Subscription(command, SubscrService
    , Some(_ => system.actorOf(props)))

}
```
Here is the complete example: 
[HelloService](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pme123/play-akka-telegrambot4s/master/app/pme/bots/examples/services/HelloService.scala)

## Conversation (statelful)
That's what you actually understand as a chat. 
A stateful conversation where the Bot guides the user through a defined process (workflow).

For a conversation we use a Finite State Machine from Akka: `akka.actor.FSM` which is also an Actor.

Here a simple conversation: 
[CounterConversation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pme123/play-akka-telegrambot4s/master/app/pme/bots/examples/conversations/CounterConversation.scala)

Here the main difference is that we now have a state that must be handled:
```scala
   when(Counting) { // when the state is Counting, this function is called
     // FSM returns an Event that contains:
     //  - the Command from the CommandDispatcher
     //  - the State from the last step (using Count(n))
     case Event(Command(msg, _), Count(n)) =>
       val count = n + 1
       requestCount += 1
       // send the updated button using the BotFacade
       bot.sendEditMessage(msg, countButton(count))
       // this is a simple conversation that stays always in the same state.
       // pass the State to the next step
       stay() using Count(count)
   }
```

# Run Aspect
This allows you to add functionality to all conversation. 
There is a `RunAspect` included that returns the actual data
from the conversation. This is helpful during development.

Here is an example:

![screenshotlogstate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3437927/32698014-e0a4c5bc-c79c-11e7-9265-94985930d3fb.png)

# Bot Facade
The [BotFacade](https://github.com/pme123/play-akka-telegrambot4s/blob/0.0.5/app/pme/bots/control/BotFacade.scala)
helps you with the reply for the Bot. 
As mentioned above, for now this is Telegram specific.

# Activation
To activate a Service or a Conversation you need these 2 steps:
## 1. Application
You have to add the following to `Module.configure()`
```
    // the generic CommandDispatcher
    bindActor[CommandDispatcher]("commandDispatcher")
    // starts the Bot itself (Boundary)
    bind(classOf[BotRunner]).asEagerSingleton()

    // your Services:
    bind(classOf[HelloServiceSubscription]).asEagerSingleton()
    // your Conversations:
    bind(classOf[CounterServiceSubscription]).asEagerSingleton()
    // your RunAspects
    bind(classOf[LogStateSubscription]).asEagerSingleton()
```

## 2. Telegram
Set the commands with the `BotFather` `/setCommands`, e.g:
```
hello - Simple Hello World.
counter - Counts the time a User hits the button.
logstate - This prints the content you have created and not persisted.
```

# Usage

`resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"`

Add dependency:

`libraryDependencies += "com.github.pme123" % "play-akka-telegrambot4s" % "0.0.5"`
